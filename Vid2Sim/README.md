## 🔔 Updates
[07/22/2025] We released the training code and scripts to generate training data from TRELLIS

[07/07/2025] We released our pipeline code, pre-trained model and the GSO testset



## 🚧 TODO List 
- [ ] Release our real-world dataset

- [x] Release the training code and the scripts to generate training data from TRELLIS

- [x] Release the pipeline code and pre-trained model

  

## 🌟 Quick Start
Following the steps in this section, you can run our whole pipeline to reconstruct the test videos simulated from [GSO](https://app.gazebosim.org/GoogleResearch/fuel/collections/Scanned%20Objects%20by%20Google%20Research) dataset.  

1. Install the dependencies (we have tested the scripts on **Ubuntu 22.04** + **Nvidia H100 / Nvidia RTX 4090**)

   ```bash
   conda create -n vid2sim python=3.10
   conda activate vid2sim2
   bash setup.sh
   ```

   **Note:** If you need to use different torch or cudatoolkit version (for correctly building other libraries), please also install the compatible version of [kaolin](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin) and [torch-cluster](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_cluster)

2. Download the [test dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VOCkvOLDFmJW0Ma6tqwaXW6vSRxhxe49/view?usp=sharing) and [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_djvSuoLUXjewOBY77W7bGCt2Nywhk3C/view?usp=sharing) (including pre-trained models and LBS template network), unzip and put them into `dataset` and `checkpoints`. The folder structure should be

      ```bash
      Vid2Sim
      |-- dataset
          └-- GSO
          	|-- backpack
          	|-- ...
          	└-- turtle
      |-- checkpoints
          |-- ckpt_lbs_template.pth
          |-- ckpt_lgm.safetensors
          └-- ckpt_phys_predictor.pth
      ```

3. Run the script to reconstruct the **toy bus** case. 

   ```bash
   python run_pipeline.py --data_name bus
   ```

   This script will run our **2-stage pipeline** to reconstruct the to appearance, geometry and physics from input videos. The script follows a single default config file `config/gso.yaml` that works for all the cases in this test set. You can modify the config as you need when you use your own data.

   The **frames** will be generated at `outputs/bus`(left video is **ground-truth** and right video is **reconstruction**)

## 🔥 Train the feed-forward predictor with Objaverse data

Our feed-forward predictor was trained on **50k** simulated animations using high-quality objects from the Objaverse dataset. 

Due to policy restrictions, we are not able to release **the originals objaverse object IDs** we used for our model. Nevertheless, [TRELLIS](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS) provides filtered high-quality Objaverse object list which can be used as a good subtitution. Here we provide a **step-by-step** tutorial for creating the training dataset using [TRELLIS](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS) data

1. Download the objaverse sketchfab dataset (see [here](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS/blob/main/DATASET.md) for more detail about the TRELLIS dataset)

   ``` bash
   python dataset_toolkits/build_metadata.py ObjaverseXL --source sketchfab --output_dir dataset/objaverse
   python dataset_toolkits/download.py ObjaverseXL --output_dir dataset/objaverse
   ```

2. Process the data list and simulate animations with **random** physical parameters

   ```bash
   python dataset_toolkits/process_objaverse_dataset.py --task process
   python dataset_toolkits/process_objaverse_dataset.py --task simulate --start_idx 0 --end_idx 1 # Only simulate 1 object as an example
   ```

3. Render the animation (if it fails to render a large amount of renderings, you can write another script to run this script multiple times)

   ```bash
   python dataset_toolkits/render_objaverse_dataset.py --start_idx 0 --end_idx 1 # Only render 1 object as an example
   ```

   After generation, the objaverse dataset structure should be like

   ```bash
   Vid2Sim
   |-- dataset
       |-- objaverse
       	|-- ...
       	|-- outputs
       	    |-- ...
       	    |-- 0a81d18db3c947fbbdc8d60edd1ef323
       	        |--meshes	
       	        |--models
       	        |--renderings
       	        |--gt_phys_params.yaml
       	        └--mesh.glb
   ```

4. Train the feed-forward predictor with rendered animations (you are also recommended to use **224x224** resolution for training since it's much faster to train and performs good)

   ```bash
   python train_preprocessing.py
   python train_predictor.py
   ```
